Step 1. Ensure that you have the dataset file named transactions.csv in the current directory.

The dataset is a subset of https://www.kaggle.com/ealaxi/paysim1/version/2 which was originally generated as part of the following research:

E. A. Lopez-Rojas , A. Elmir, and S. Axelsson. "PaySim: A financial mobile money simulator for fraud detection". In: The 28th European Modeling and Simulation Symposium-EMSS, Larnaca, Cyprus. 2016

Step 2. Complete the following exercises.

Read the dataset (transactions.csv) as a Pandas dataframe. Note that the first row of the CSV contains the column names.

Return the column names as a list from the dataframe.

Return the first k rows from the dataframe.

Return a random sample of k rows from the dataframe.

Return a list of the unique transaction types.

Return a Pandas series of the top 10 transaction destinations with frequencies.

Return all the rows from the dataframe for which fraud was detected.

Bonus. Return a dataframe that contains the number of distinct destinations that each source has interacted with to, sorted in descending order. You will find groupby and agg useful. The predefined aggregate functions are under pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.*. See the left hand column.

Use the empty cell to test the exercises. If you modify the original df, you can rerun the cell containing exercise_0.
